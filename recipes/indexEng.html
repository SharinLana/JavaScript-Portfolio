            <p>Cut the bread into slices, remove the crusts and, without crumbling, fill it with water (the amount of water depends on the capacity, it does not matter in principle, since we will squeeze out the water). Let the bread soften in water for a few minutes, do not squeeze too hard. The bread crumb should be about a third (at least a quarter) of the amount of meat. <br> First we scroll the meat, then the onion, then the crumb in the meat grinder, add salt and pepper, water, stir and beat off. But instead of beating, you can beat with a mixer until smooth for several minutes, remove the veins remaining on the whisks. <br> Form cutlets of the size you need, roll in flour or breadcrumbs and fry on both sides, then close the lid and bring to readiness over low heat.</p>

            <p>Prepare the onions first, as the potatoes darken quickly. Grind the onion in a blender or grate on a fine grater. Grate peeled potatoes on a fine grater in a separate bowl, put on a sieve and drain the excess liquid or squeeze with your hands. Starch will remain in the liquid at the bottom, you can add it back. <br> Add onion, salt, pepper to potatoes, stir. <br> Scoop up the mixture with a tablespoon and form a cake with our hands, put it on a preheated pan, with a small amount of vegetable oil.

Combine the dough with your hands, knead for a short time, only to unite, otherwise the butter will begin to melt. Form 10 balls and send to the freezer for 30 minutes.

Bake in the oven at 200°C each cake for about 5-7 minutes. It will turn out 10 cakes and trimmings, 9 cakes will go into the cake, the 10th cake with scraps into crumbs.</p>
            <p>Make cream: Pour milk into a saucepan, add half of the sugar, put on a small fire. Mix eggs, flour, vanilla sugar and the remaining half of the sugar until smooth in a bowl with a whisk.

Then we combine the egg-milk mixture with milk and put on a small fire, stir constantly, the mass will begin to thicken, when the mass becomes creamy, remove from heat and add oil in 2-3 batches, stir with a whisk.

            <h4 class="ingredients">Ingredients:</h4>
            <h5>Dough:</h5>
            <ul>
               <li>350 grams of unsalted butter;</li>
               <li>400 grams of floor;</li>
               <li>150 ml of iced water</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Filling:</h5>
            <ul>
               <li>180 grams of unsalted butter;</li>
               <li>1/2 can of condenced milk;</li>
               <li>cowberry jam</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="ingredients">Cooking:</h4>
            <p>Remove the butter from the freezer and rub it on a grater, quickly, until it begins to soften, add the flour sifted through a sieve and chop with a sharp knife. Then add water a little bit and chop again, knead a homogeneous dough, divide into 8 equal balls and put in the freezer for 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>Then get one ball at a time, roll it out thinly, cut out a circle (diameter 18 cm) with a plate, make pricks in several places with a fork and send it to the oven preheated to 200°C. Bake each cake until golden brown. Take out the cakes very carefully, as they turn out to be very airy, crumbly, fragile and with bubbles. Bake the remaining dough scraps separately, this dough will go for crumbs for sprinkling the cake. Cool the cakes.</p>
            <p>Make cream: beat condensed milk with butter at room temperature until creamy. Lubricate the first cake with cream, the second with cowberry jam, and so on in turn. Lubricate the edges with cream, sprinkle with crumbs and put in the refrigerator for impregnation.</p>
